# Raspberry-pi-Control-5-Servo-motors
This Project is Part of a Senior project to control hand movements using tower Servo motors.
# Features
Sequential Movement: The servos are moved one after the other, each moving from left to neutral to right.
Simultaneous Movement: All servos move at once from left to neutral to right.
# Requirements
Raspberry Pi (tested with Raspberry Pi 4)
Servo motors (tested with 5 servos)
Python 3
RPi.GPIO library
# Usage
Connect your servo motors to the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi. Make sure to connect the signal wire to the correct GPIO pin, the power wire to a suitable power source, and the ground wire to the ground of both the Raspberry Pi and the power source.
Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
Run the Python script to start controlling your servo motors.
